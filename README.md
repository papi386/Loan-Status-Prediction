********Loan Status Prediction********
*****Overview*****
This repository contains a comprehensive data analysis and modeling project aimed at predicting loan statuses using machine learning techniques. The goal is to determine whether a loan will be paid back on time (1) or defaulted (0), helping lenders make informed decisions based on borrower characteristics and loan details.

*****Features*****
***Data Analysis***: In-depth exploration of the dataset, including data cleaning, feature engineering, and visualization to identify trends and relationships.
*****Modeling*****: Implementation of various machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, decision trees, and ensemble methods, to predict loan statuses.
*****Model Evaluation*****: Use of performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC to assess the effectiveness of different models.
Threshold Optimization: Exploration of different classification thresholds to maximize model performance and reduce misclassification.
